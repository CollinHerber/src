Plans for further improvement:
1) Implement ABC2 (firstly understand ABC2. Some is present such as idle actions, but I do not understand the rest)
2) Count the amount of items that need to be looted, if inventory is full eat the required amount of food to make space
3) Implement a semi-automatic mule functionality to it. Should not be hard to create, but will be developed over time to become more autonomous
4) Adjust script so that it always remains zoomed out and the camera roatation remains high.
5) Can improve logic in combat, sometimes attacks next before looting last (not a big issue)
6) Long term, I want to make this a script that I will release publicly. Will add a GUI, custom settings, Arguments, Restocking etc.
